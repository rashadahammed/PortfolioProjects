USE PortfolioProject;

-- 1. 

Select SUM(new_cases) as total_cases, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as total_deaths, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int))/SUM(New_Cases)*100 as DeathPercentage
From covid_death
where continent is not null 
order by 1,2



-- 2. 



Select location, SUM(cast(new_deaths as int)) as TotalDeathCount
From covid_death
Where continent is null 
and location not in ('World', 'European Union', 'International','High income','Upper middle income','Low income','Lower middle income')
Group by location
order by TotalDeathCount desc


-- 3.

Select Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) as HighestInfectionCount,  Max((total_cases/population))*100 as PercentPopulationInfected
From covid_death
Group by Location, Population
order by PercentPopulationInfected desc


-- 4.
